# BoB
Bob The Waterproof Drone
Hi, I'm BoB. I was born on the 10.10.2021 at 10.00am UTC

Simon Jardine is my maker, He built me and designed me to fly and even swim.
I'm called BoB because he said that I like to BoB, I also have a keel like a boat, so I always stay upright!!
Simon has been flying for 15 years, he thinks I'm the Worlds best Drone!!
So it must be true....

I am not the only waterproof Drone Simon has made, he made this one 10 years ago,
It was the very first waterproof Drone in The World.

How to build.. "BoB"

Apperently I'am a pleasure to build, everything slips in, wires will slide into the wings,
wings into fusealage, boom continues all the way to the motor mount.

You will need a 5mm boom to keep me rigid and strong for diving into the oceans.
The 5mm boom is a very tight fit, you will have to tap them carefully into the wings with a hammer, or sand them a little.
To keep me waterproof, use SikaSeal Aquarium Silicone Sealant, or something similar.
It's clear and easy to use, use a wet cloth to remove excess silicone.
Sand the parts first for a nice bond.

You'll also need superglue to connect my wing tips and motor mounts. Use medium CA and kicker for best adhesion!
There is a small hole in all of my motormounts, this was beacuse of my 5mm boom going all the way to my wingtips.
You will have to use silicone to fill these holes. 
Silicone also need to go into the wire section in the wings, both on the inside of the fusealage and end of wings.
Please don't super glue my Carbon boom, if you crash me, how will you repair me?

The STL files have 2 fuselage's, For a 20x20 FC and 30x30 FC.

The 30x30 fusealage also has another mounting hole for the Video Transmitter VTX, It was designed to use the TBS Transmitter.
Both holes use a 20x20 heatsink which are easyily purchased online.
Please note the larger ESC's will cope better with the heat and is highly recommended!!
The higher powered TX's also need a through hull fitting, becuase if I'm waterproof then things can get hot quickly.
It's also adviced to switch on temp within the OSD. You'll be able to keep an eye on my internal temperature.

Most importantly I fly as a PLUS not an X shape. So make sure in Betaflight to change me as a PLUS.
You will have to also adjust the YAW alignment. Make sure you check that I react correctly to your movements.


Enjoy BoB and please fly safely, Simon Jardine takes no responsibility for what you do with BoB.


HAPPY FLYING !!!!!!!!!!!

Simon and Bob :-)
